# Generic-Webpage-Generator
Welcome to the Generic Webpage Generator!

The generator allows the user to provide specific details in order to create a webpage that fits their needs. The program simply runs through the console, and the user must provide an answer for every prompt so that the website can be generated at the end of the process.

The webpage template is based off of The Odin Project's Landing Page, in order to keep the design general enough to fit every user's needs.

To get started, simply place the .py file within a folder, and after answering all prompts when running the file, your new html file will be present within the folder itself.

You're all Set! Make your dream webpage now!
